# NeuralNet

Orignial this Net came from a Tutorial.

It uses Bias Neurons so dont get confused about the extra Neuron we 
"basically" never use.

Summary:
It is a simple Net where every Neuron is connected to every Neuron in
the next Layer, the InputLayer isn't really a layer because we only 
set the OutputValues there. The Bias-Units have no connections from there
previous layers.
